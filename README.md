# IIITB_Advanced_Physical_Design_using_OpenLANE_Sky130

This project was completed as part of the "Advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE/Sky130" course by VLSI System Design Corporation. It encompasses the entire RTL to GDSII flow for the PicoRV32a System-on-Chip (SoC) using the OpenLANE toolchain with the Skywater130nm Process Design Kit (PDK). In addition to the standard flow, custom-designed standard cells within the Sky130 PDK were integrated, timing optimizations were performed to meet design constraints, slack violations were rectified, and DRC (Design Rule Check) was rigorously verified.
